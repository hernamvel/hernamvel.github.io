  <p>My name is Hern&aacute;n Vel&aacute;squez.  I'm Colombian Senior Software Engenieer with more than
  15 years developing software.</p>
  
  <p>I started to use Ruby on Rails on 2012 for a startup named 'SweatDrops'.
  Before that, I developed several applications mainly in Php and Java.  Although I still mantain some
  of those apps, my focus and line of interest is in Ruby on Rails.</p>
