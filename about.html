  <p>My name is Hern&aacute;n Vel&aacute;squez.  I'm Colombian Senior Software Engenieer with more than
  15 years developing software and a consultant on Gamification.</p>
  
  <p>I started to use Ruby on Rails on 2012 for a startup named 'SweatDrops', and then I did some
  Python development for a very cool startup <a href='sqor.com'>Sqor.com</a> in San Francisco.
  Before that, I developed several applications mainly in Php and Java.  Although I still mantain some
  of those apps, my focus and line of interest is in Ruby on Rails.</p>
  
  <p>On 2013 I cofounded with my brother, <a href='https://twitter.com/JavierVelasqN'>Javier Vel&aacute;squez</a>, <a href='http://f2p.co'>F2P - Free to Play SAS</a> and his sister
  	company in the US, Vibratil LLC.  Javier is a Senior Game Designer who launched several board games and we founded F2P to
  	explore Gamification, my other main line of interest. The most amazing experience is that this venture made
  	him learned from me RoR to help in the products we're launching, and I learned from him Gamification to help
  	him on the consulting projects we're running in these days.</p>
