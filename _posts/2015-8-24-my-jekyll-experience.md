title: My first post - My jekyll experience
---

I was long overdue for sharing my experience as a Rails Developer and a Gamification consultant, but when I tried to start I always failed
to find a comfortable blogging tool for me.  I tried tools like Wordpress but it seemed to complicated for me.

Well, my search is over and the winner is Jekyll.  Its awesome.  I followed this [tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) 
and thanks to Barry Clark who shared this template: [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), I'm now on my way.

I feel pretty excited to start writting and sharing what I learned since I started to use Ruby on Rails on 2012.
